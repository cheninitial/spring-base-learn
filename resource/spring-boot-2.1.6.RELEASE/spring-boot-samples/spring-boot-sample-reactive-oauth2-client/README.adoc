= Spring Boot Sample Reactive OAuth2 Client

== Register Github OAuth2 application
To run the sample, you need to link:https://github.com/settings/applications/new[register an OAuth application on Github].
While registering your application, ensure the Authorization callback URL is set to http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github.
After completing the registration, you will have a new OAuth Application with a Client ID and Client Secret.

== Configuring application.yml
Once the OAuth application is registered with GitHub, you need to configure the sample application to use this OAuth application (client).
Edit the link:src/main/resources/application.yml[application.yml] and replace ${APP-CLIENT-ID} and ${APP-CLIENT-SECRET} with the OAuth client credentials created in the previous section.

The sample can now be run and you can login with your Github user credentials.
