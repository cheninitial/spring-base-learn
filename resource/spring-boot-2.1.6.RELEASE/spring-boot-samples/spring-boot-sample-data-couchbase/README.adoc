= Spring Boot Couchbase Sample

This sample demonstrates how you can store a simple document using Spring Data Couchbase.

The sample expects couchbase to run on your machine with a bucket named `default` and
no password. You can customize these settings in `application.properties`.

This sample also configures the `auto-index` property and the `UserRepository` defines
the `all` view so you should be able to invoke `findAll` for this sample.

== Creating the view manually

If you don't want to rely on `auto-index` and better understand how this works behind the
scenes, you need to create an `all` view for the `User`. Go to the Couchbase serverâ€™s
admin console and visit the Views screen, then click `Create Development View` and name
it `all` with `user` as document name. On that view, you need to change the code to:

```java
function (doc, meta) {
  if (doc._class == "sample.data.couchbase.User") {
    emit(meta.id, null);
  }
}
```

and the _reduce_ function to `_count`. After you've saved your changes go back to `Views`
and click on `Publish` so that the `all` view move to the `Production Views` tab.
